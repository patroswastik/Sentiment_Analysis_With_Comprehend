# Real-Time Social Media Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This project focuses on building a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline using big data technologies such as AWS Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB, and Comprehend. The system streams, processes, and analyzes real-time social media data to detect sentiment trends, benefiting businesses, marketers, and researchers in monitoring and responding to public opinion quickly.

## Problem Statement

The rapid growth of social media has led to an overwhelming influx of user-generated content. Understanding public sentiment in real-time is challenging due to the high volume and velocity of data. Existing systems often suffer from latency, lack of scalability, or limited analytical capabilities.

## Objectives

- Develop a scalable and efficient pipeline to capture real-time social media data.
- Process and analyze sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) using AWS Comprehend.
- Store sentiment data and metadata using AWS DynamoDB.
- Visualize real-time sentiment trends through an interactive dashboard.
- Ensure high availability and performance using AWS CloudWatch for monitoring.

## Technical Stack

### Data Collection

- **AWS Kinesis Data Streams** - Captures real-time data from social media APIs or simulated data generators.
- **Python with Faker Library** - Generates mock tweet data for testing.

### Data Processing

- **AWS Lambda** - Processes data as it arrives in the Kinesis stream.
- **Sentiment Classification with AWS Comprehend**
- **Data Storage with AWS DynamoDB**

### Data Visualization

- **Python with Matplotlib and Seaborn** - For generating visual analytics.
- **Dashboard Features:**
  - Real-Time Sentiment Trends
  - Top Regions by Tweet Count
  - Sentiment Analysis by Age and Gender
  - Region vs Sentiment Heatmap

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

1. **Handling High Data Volume:**

   - Used AWS Kinesis Shards to distribute the data processing load.
   - Configured concurrent AWS Lambda executions for parallelized processing.

2. **Ensuring Low Latency:**

   - Optimized Lambda functions for reduced cold start times.
   - Streamlined data transformation steps for efficiency.

3. **Sentiment Accuracy:**

   - Implemented custom preprocessing for emojis, abbreviations, and slang.
   - Fine-tuned AWS Comprehend with additional training data.

## Results and Analysis

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Data Ingestion (Kinesis): **100 ms per record**
  - Data Processing (Lambda): **200 ms per tweet**
  - Sentiment Analysis (Comprehend): **300 ms per analysis**
- **Sentiment Analysis Results:**
  - **Positive Tweets:** 12.7%
  - **Neutral Tweets:** 45.1%
  - **Negative Tweets:** 37.8%
  - **Mixed Tweets:** 4.5%

## Future Scope

- **Multilingual Support** - Extend analysis to multiple languages.
- **Enhanced Visualization** - Integration with AWS QuickSight.
- **Additional Data Sources** - Extend analysis beyond Twitter to Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
- **Advanced Sentiment Models** - Train custom deep learning models using AWS SageMaker.
- **Real-Time Alerts** - Implement real-time alerts based on sentiment trends.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a scalable real-time sentiment analysis pipeline using AWS tools. By leveraging AWS Kinesis for data ingestion, AWS Lambda for processing, AWS Comprehend for sentiment analysis, and DynamoDB for storage, the system ensures high performance and scalability. Future enhancements, such as multilingual support and advanced visualization, will further extend the systemâ€™s capabilities.
